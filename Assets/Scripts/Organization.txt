-IHitEffect: Triggered by Projectile. Creates graphical effects for hits.
--HitEffect: Creates a given GameObject as the effect.
--SimpleHit: Creates an empty game object and assigns a Sprite and a Lifetime to it.
-ObjectTrail: Creates a given GameObject every given number of ticks.
-SimpleTrail: Creates a GameObject with the same sprite and scale, and assigns a Lifetime to it.
-IOnObjDestroyed: Triggered by Damageable upon object destruction.
--IFragmentExplosion: Creates a ring of given GameObjects of given radius and count with given speed and angular velocity
-IDevice: Has a single function to be activated by a Starship.
--IDrive: Applies a force to the Starship object in order to cause motion. Also creates Exhaust projectiles.
---Drive: Standard implementation
--IWeapon: Component that creates a Projectile upon activation.

-Swivel: Component that allows a weapon to rotate within a limited range.
-Turret: Component that allows a weapon to rotate (should be connected to Swivel via interface)
-Turret_Mouse: Same functionality as a turret, but follows the mouse (should be replaced with a generalized MouseAim component)
-Lifetime: Destroys an object after a given time (should fire IOnObjDestroyed)
-Starship: Tracks devices and statuses
-SpriteFade: Makes a sprite fade over time. Redundant with Lifetime (should fix this)
-SpriteScale: Makes a sprite shrink over time. Redundant with Lifetime (should fix this)
-Helper: Does miscellaneous math calculations
